The AI engineer's work primarily involved evolving a Lumaa AI application from a conversion-optimized landing page to a complex, unified system with authentication and a multi-role dashboard. Initial efforts focused on frontend UI/UX (React, Spline, SEO) and setting up a separate Express.js backend for authentication. A significant challenge was unifying these into a single React application, leading to routing and state management complexities. The AI successfully implemented simplified login credentials for demo purposes by modifying frontend configuration and integrating authentication routes into the FastAPI backend (initially designed for the landing page). Subsequent work focused on implementing a detailed set of refined dashboard requirements, including role-based views, user management with pause/play and add user functionality, and a comprehensive payment/billing system. Throughout this, the AI encountered and resolved several frontend compilation errors, JavaScript runtime errors (), and role-based access control issues ( vs  roles). The latest task involves migrating the entire database from SQLite/Prisma to PostgreSQL with an expanded schema to support the new features.

The goal is a launchable MVP for Lumaa AI â€” AI That Speaks Business. Phase 1 (completed) was a conversion-optimized React landing page with specific dark-themed UI/UX, 3D Spline, SEO, analytics, and a functional contact form. Phase 3 (in progress) involves a secure authentication and dashboard system. The backend uses Express.js (originally intended, but authentication was moved to FastAPI for unification) with PostgreSQL (SQLite for MVP demo). Authentication is JWT-based, admin-creates-user, with Login with Google planned.
Refined dashboard requirements specify:
**User Dashboard**: No revenue, niche-based access, CSV lead upload (sales-only, PIN-protected), PIN protection for bot pause/resume, user-editable prompt and opening message.
**Admin Panel**: Focus on user management (no call logs), usage metrics, payment plans, revenue per user, global and individual user pause/resume, universal bot settings per category.
**New Features**: Settings page (password, PIN), PIN system, category management, CSV upload, payment system (monthly billing, admin payment links, user top-up credits).
**UI Behavior**: Correct navigation active states.

Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was tasked with migrating the application's database and data to PostgreSQL with an expanded schema. This follows the successful implementation of a refined dashboard system, which included:
- Functional login for admin (/) and user (/).
- Role-based dashboard views:
    - **Admin**: Overview (revenue, total usage, top users), User Management (add, edit, pause/resume users, revenue/usage display), Bot Settings (model and temperature per category).
    - **User**: Overview (no revenue), Call Logs (lead details only), Bot Settings (read-only model/temperature, editable prompt/opening message), Payments (credit balance, top-up, payment history, billing date).
- A payment and billing system (backend APIs and frontend components for credit top-ups, monthly billing, admin payment links).
The AI successfully fixed multiple frontend issues like  errors, incorrect role-based navigation, and a  syntax error.

The very last actions involved installing PostgreSQL dependencies (, ) and creating new backend files:  (SQLAlchemy ORM definitions) and  (PostgreSQL connection manager). The AI was in the process of updating the environment to use PostgreSQL and creating the database.
